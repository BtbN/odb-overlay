ODB Free Proprietary License (FPL)

In addition to the Commercial Proprietary License we offer a free
version for handling small object models. This license allows you
to use ODB in a proprietary (closed-source) application free of
charge and without any of the GPLv2 restrictions provided that
the amount of the generated database support code in any single
release of your application does not exceed 10,000 lines.

To start using ODB under the free proprietary license simply
contact us and we will send you a copy of the license agreement.
